        "description": "Builds on the foundation provided in ALY 6000 and ALY 6010 by exploring at greater depth the tools of data correction and recoding, as well as those of statistics and R. Offers students an opportunity to learn to discern and validate meaningful and statistically significant patterns in data through sound applications of the scientific method. Emphasizes initial mastery of correlation and regression, ANOVA, GLM, and logistic regression. Introduces the more advanced techniques of multivariable regression and nonparametric statistics and sampling. The goal of this course is to offer students an opportunity to master the fundamental skills of data management, analysis, and communication, which are the core data analytical competencies required of today’s analytic professionals.",
